# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

Airplane, one of the most important transportation facilities in the world, play a remarkable role in shortening the distance between human-beings. People can always arrive at another side of earth in a day by taking an airplane.   
The project aims to draw insights from a dataset collected from airplane passenger satisfication survey and develop business suggestions for airplane companies. This could include recommendations for improving certain aspects of the airline experience, such as in-flight entertainment, seating arrangements, or food and beverage offerings.
Furthermore, the project builds a clustering model dividing customers up to several segments based on satisfaction ratings and other demographic information.This can help the airline company better understand the needs and preferences of different types of customers and tailor their services accordingly.
Lastly, inspired from prior cluster algorithm, the project also introduces a predictive model with input of passengers' basic demographic information to predict which aspect of airline service the passenger care the most. This can help the airline company prioritize their efforts and allocate resources more effectively.
